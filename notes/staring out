Notes on how this was done!

1. I was new to HTML and I got a very basic bare bone template to get me started. You can see it in frontend as the index.
2. Next I made the CSS file. Once again very basic template to get started. I wanted to make it in a dark mode where and mess around with centering the doc HTML
